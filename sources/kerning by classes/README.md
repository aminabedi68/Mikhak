fontforge has an <a href="https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4536">issue</a> prevents users to create kerning by classes for glyphs in Arabic script, but we can use this kerning method to create kerning pairs so much easier, to do that we should do the same levels for kerning classes and save lookup (Mikhak-Kerning Classes.fea), do the regex(Regex to fix fontforge kerning by classes.txt) and bring back the file(Mikhak-Kerning Classes - after Regex.fea) to the fontforge.
